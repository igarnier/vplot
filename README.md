# vplot
Plotting library built on top of owl, vlayout, cairo2, batteries and tsdl.

WARNING: this library is not ready for consumption. Use at your own risks.

TODO:
* Fix rendering pipeline, it is stupid right now.

* Other types of plots:
- plotting functions (ongoing)
- legends for figures and axes

* Stuff to fix:
- add gradient legend to heatmap
- optimise drawing
